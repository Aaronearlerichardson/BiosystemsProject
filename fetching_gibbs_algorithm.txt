first, find the reaction number (rn) in the kegg database:
http://rest.kegg.jp/find/reaction/formate

Then plug that number into the url below:
https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?rn:R03907

Again, pray that this page has a MetaCyc database number and insert that number into this url:
https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=EC-NUMBER&object=EC-1.17.1.10

search the text of that page for a gibbs free energy reading (if it has one) and there is your reaction energy!

for Km, temp, and ph go to
https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/enzyme.php?ecno=1.14.99.21

idk man
