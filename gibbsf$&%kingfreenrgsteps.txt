first, find the reaction number (rn) in the kegg database:
http://rest.kegg.jp/find/reaction/formate

Then plug that number into the url below:
https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?rn:R03907

Pray that the page has a rhea database number. If it does, insert that number into this url:
https://www.rhea-db.org/reaction?id=12680

Again, pray that this page has a MetaCyc database number and insert that number into this url:
https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=REACTION&object=1.14.99.21-RXN

search the text of that page for a gibbs free energy reading (if it has one) and there is your reaction energy!
